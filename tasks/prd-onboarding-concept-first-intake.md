# Product Requirements Document: Onboarding & Concept-First Intake

## Introduction/Overview

The Onboarding & Concept-First Intake feature addresses the critical pain point of users struggling to know where to start learning a topic.This feature provides a fast, intuitive entry point where users can input any concept and quickly receive a structured learning plan.

**Goal:** Create a frictionless onboarding experience that gets users from concept input to a personalized learning plan in under 30 seconds, reducing abandonment and increasing engagement with the learning platform.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Time-to-Value:** Get users from initial concept to actionable learning plan in <30 seconds
2. **Increase Onboarding Completion:** Improve completion rate of onboarding flow by 40%
3. **Maximize Plan Generation:** Achieve 85% of users reaching the Proposed Plan stage
4. **Support Universal Learning:** Handle concepts across all domains and skill levels
5. **Minimize Cognitive Load:** Require minimal decision-making during initial setup

## User Stories

**Primary Flow:**
- As a learner, I want to type "React useEffect" and quickly get a structured learning plan so that I can start learning immediately without researching where to begin.
- As a student, I want to paste a research paper URL and receive a learning roadmap so that I can systematically understand complex academic content.
- As a professional, I want to upload a PDF manual and get a study plan so that I can efficiently learn new job-related skills.

**Secondary Flows:**
- As a busy learner, I want to specify I only have 30 minutes per day so that my learning plan fits my schedule.
- As a beginner, I want to indicate my skill level so that the plan doesn't overwhelm me with advanced concepts.
- As an explorer, I want to see example topics so that I can discover new learning opportunities.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Input Processing
1. The system must provide a prominent text input field for concept entry supporting free-form text (e.g., "cardiac physiology basics", "machine learning fundamentals")
2. The system must support URL pasting with automatic content detection and parsing
3. The system must support file upload functionality for PDFs and common document formats
4. The system must process concept inputs and generate responses within 30 seconds

### User Interface Elements
5. The system must display curated example concept chips organized by category (technology, science, business, etc.)
6. The system must provide simple timebox selection with preset options for minutes per day (15, 30, 60) and duration in weeks (1-4 weeks, 1-3 months)
7. The system must offer a 3-tier skill level selector (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
8. The system must include an optional preferred format selector (videos, articles, interactive, mixed)

### Output Generation
9. The system must generate a Proposed Plan containing a learning timeline with specific resources and materials
10. The system must create an integrated learning experience where the plan serves as the foundation for the full curriculum
11. The system must display estimated time commitments and key learning milestones
12. The system must provide a clear path to proceed to full curriculum building

### Technical Integration
13. The system must integrate with a file upload parser (starting with PDF support, expandable to other formats)
14. The system must connect seamlessly with the Curriculum Builder Lite component
15. The system must handle concept processing through the existing learning content recommendation engine

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Complex Domain Taxonomy UI:** No elaborate category trees or advanced filtering interfaces
2. **Advanced Scheduling:** No calendar integration or complex time management features
3. **Social Features:** No sharing, collaboration, or community aspects in initial version
4. **Assessment Integration:** No built-in testing or evaluation during onboarding
5. **Multi-language Support:** English-only for initial release
6. **Advanced Analytics:** Basic metrics only, no detailed learning analytics
7. **Offline Functionality:** Online-only experience

## Design Considerations

### User Experience
- **Single-page flow:** Minimize navigation and keep all onboarding elements on one screen
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show advanced options (timebox, level, format) only after concept input
- **Visual feedback:** Clear progress indicators and loading states for file processing
- **Mobile-responsive:** Ensure functionality across all device sizes

### Visual Design
- **Prominent input field:** Large, centrally-placed concept input with placeholder examples
- **Example chips:** Visually distinct, clickable chips grouped by category
- **Clean layout:** Minimal distractions, focus on the core input-to-plan flow
- **Consistent styling:** Align with existing application UI components and design system

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Upload Parser:** Requires implementation of file processing service (start with PDF stub)
- **Curriculum Builder Lite:** Must integrate with existing curriculum generation logic
- **Content Recommendation Engine:** Needs access to learning resource database
- **Base UI Structure:** Leverages existing application UI framework (noted as already complete)

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** <30 seconds from concept submission to plan display
- **File Processing:** Support files up to 10MB initially
- **Concurrent Users:** Handle at least 100 simultaneous onboarding sessions

### Data Requirements
- **Concept Processing:** Store user inputs for improvement of recommendation algorithms
- **User Preferences:** Persist timebox, level, and format preferences for future sessions
- **Analytics Data:** Track completion rates, drop-off points, and time-to-plan metrics

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Onboarding Completion Rate:** Target 85% completion (improvement from current baseline)
- **Plan Generation Rate:** 85% of users who input concepts reach the Proposed Plan stage
- **Time to Plan:** Average time from concept input to plan display <30 seconds

### Secondary Metrics
- **User Engagement:** 70% of users who complete onboarding proceed to full curriculum
- **Concept Diversity:** Track variety of topics entered to ensure broad appeal
- **Format Preferences:** Monitor preferred learning formats to optimize content recommendations
- **Return Usage:** 60% of onboarded users return within 7 days

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- ✅ User can input any text concept and receive a relevant learning plan
- ✅ User can paste URLs and system extracts learning objectives
- ✅ User can upload PDF files and system processes content for plan generation
- ✅ System responds with Proposed Plan within 30 seconds using mock data in development

### User Experience
- ✅ Example chips are clickable and populate the concept input field
- ✅ Timebox and skill level selections modify the generated plan appropriately
- ✅ Interface is responsive and functional on mobile devices
- ✅ Clear error handling for unsupported files or processing failures

### Integration
- ✅ Seamless handoff to Curriculum Builder Lite maintains user context
- ✅ File upload parser successfully processes PDF content (stub implementation acceptable for initial release)
- ✅ Generated plans include realistic timeline and resource estimates

## Open Questions

1. **Content Quality Control:** How should we handle inappropriate or extremely niche concept inputs?
2. **Personalization Depth:** Should we capture additional user context (background, goals) for better recommendations?
3. **Error Recovery:** What fallback options should we provide if concept processing fails?
4. **Analytics Implementation:** Which specific user interaction events should we track for optimization?
5. **Scalability Planning:** At what user volume should we consider caching or pre-processing popular concepts?
