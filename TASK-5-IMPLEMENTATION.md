# Task 5: Guest Mode Seamless Upgrade - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete guest mode to authenticated user upgrade system that allows users to start using the app immediately without registration, and later seamlessly upgrade to a full account while preserving all their progress.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
- **Supabase Integration**: Added @supabase/supabase-js and @supabase/ssr packages
- **Client/Server Setup**: Created browser and server Supabase clients with proper cookie handling
- **Middleware**: Implemented authentication middleware with guest-friendly routing
- **Environment Configuration**: Added .env.example with required Supabase keys

### 2. Authentication Context & Hooks
- **AuthProvider** (`/lib/auth/auth-context.tsx`): 
  - Manages user state and session
  - Provides `isGuest` flag for UI decisions
  - Handles guest-to-authenticated upgrade flow
  - Includes sign out functionality

- **useGuestMode Hook** (`/hooks/use-guest-mode.ts`):
  - Manages guest data in localStorage
  - Handles anonymous user creation
  - Provides data migration functionality
  - Saves/retrieves guest progress locally

### 3. Upgrade Flow UI
- **UpgradeModal** (`/components/auth/upgrade-modal.tsx`):
  - Multi-step upgrade process (form → migration → success)
  - Email/password collection with validation
  - Automatic data migration from localStorage to Supabase
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Success confirmation with auto-close

- **Login Page** (`/app/login/page.tsx`):
  - Tabbed interface for sign in/sign up
  - Form validation and error handling
  - "Continue as Guest" option
  - Supabase authentication integration

### 4. Updated Existing Components

#### Guest Banner (`/components/guest-banner.tsx`)
- Now integrates with auth context
- Only shows for guest users
- Triggers upgrade modal when clicked

#### Layout Wrapper (`/components/layout-wrapper.tsx`)
- Conditionally shows guest banner based on auth state
- Passes upgrade handler to banner

#### Dashboard (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Integrates upgrade modal
- Shows appropriate welcome message (Guest vs user email)
- Handles upgrade success callbacks

#### Homepage (`/app/page.tsx`)
- Auto-redirects authenticated users to dashboard
- Initializes guest mode when "Start as Guest" is clicked
- Loading state while checking authentication
- Links to login page for sign in

#### Root Layout (`/app/layout.tsx`)
- Wraps entire app with AuthProvider
- Enables authentication context throughout the app

## Data Flow

### Guest Mode Initialization
1. User clicks "Start as Guest"
2. Anonymous user created in Supabase with `is_guest: true` metadata
3. User can use all app features
4. Progress saved to localStorage

### Upgrade Process
1. User clicks "Upgrade" button in guest banner or dashboard
2. UpgradeModal opens with email/password form
3. User submits credentials
4. System updates anonymous user with email/password and sets `is_guest: false`
5. Guest data migrated from localStorage to Supabase database
6. localStorage cleared
7. User now has full authenticated account with preserved data

### Authentication States
- **No User**: Shows onboarding start screen
- **Guest User**: Shows app with guest banner and upgrade prompts
- **Authenticated User**: Shows full app without guest prompts

## Security Considerations
- Anonymous users have limited database access through RLS policies
- Guest data stored locally until upgrade
- Middleware allows guest access to most routes
- Only admin/settings routes require full authentication

## Environment Variables Required
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here
```

## Database Schema Assumptions
The implementation assumes tables with `user_id` columns:
- `curricula` - User's learning plans
- `flashcards` - User's flashcard decks
- `user_progress` - Learning progress tracking

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Guest mode initialization works
- [x] Guest banner shows/hides correctly
- [x] Upgrade modal opens and validates input
- [x] Data migration preserves user progress
- [x] Authenticated users don't see guest prompts
- [x] Login page works for existing users
- [x] Routing handles all authentication states

## Future Enhancements
- Email verification for new accounts
- Social login options (Google, GitHub)
- Account deletion and data export
- Enhanced data migration with conflict resolution
- Offline support for guest mode
